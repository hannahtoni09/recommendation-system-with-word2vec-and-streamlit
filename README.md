On the app you can allow (check or uncheck) the two recommendations on the sidebar. 
The first one recommends items based on one individual input item. 
The second that comes with a slider, does some recommendations based on all a customer's purchases. Each number on the slider is an individual customer.
Then, the algorithm downloads those items's pictures on Google Image and show you what the recommendations look like (might take a minute).
