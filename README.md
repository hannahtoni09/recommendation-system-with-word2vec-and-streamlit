On the app you can allow (choose to check or uncheck) the two recommendations on the sidebar. The first one recommends items based on one individual input item. The second that comes with a slider, does some recommendations based on all a customer's purchases. Then, the algorithm downloads those items's pictures on Google Image and show you what the recommendations look like (might take a minute).
